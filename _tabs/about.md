My name is Vladimir Podolskiy.
Currently, I work as a distributed systems specialist at HiveMQ which main product is a production-grade MQTT broker.
Recently, I've defended my PhD thesis on the topic of predictive autoscaling for cloud applications.

With this personal website, I aim to share my insights into the technologies in such areas as distributed systems, Internet of Things, and resource management for cloud.
