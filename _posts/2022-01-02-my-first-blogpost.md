## Purpose of this blog

Working part-time as a journalist at the university newspaper for a couple of years and publishing research papers for at least 11 years, I became aware that writing stuff down makes one's thinking process clearer.
This is why I practice writing as my daily routine.
It helps me both to set the goals for the coming day and to shape my understanding of the code when chasing some bizarre bug.
Writing helps to capture important ideas from the books that I read and to fit them into my own mental model using the right words and associations.

[David Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch) contributed a beautiful and deep idea to the body of modern philosophy of science.
He views **progress** as an ongoing process of improving explanations.
Humanity proceeds from one explanation of some phenomenon or an event to another, better one.
Improving our explanations of some events, other people behaviours, or even technologies result in better understanding and a holistic outlook on everything that surrounds us.
Writing helps us on this path.
Writing explanation after explanation sheds more light onto the phenomena that we are interested in.
By gradually improving the written explanation, one can acquire better picture of the subject in focus.

If we apply the approach of improving written explanations to technologies and tools, over time, we will get a refined understanding of inner workings of particular technology or a tool and how it best fits to solving a particular problem.
More importantly, we will also identify the limitations of the technology and the trajectory of the technology's future development.

With this blog, I want both to improve my own understanding of technologies that I come into contact with and to share my insights with those few that are ready to dive into the tech.
